INTRO: My project is about a pet store business game, which exploits class structure to manage data and game mechanism.

==================================================================================

GAME MECHANICS: Use number on keyboard to choose each option. And players are recommended to follow instruction that provided inside the game. If player tries to break the rule, there will be warning to stop the game.

==================================================================================


METHOD: Using all aspects of OOP: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Advancedly, vector and pointer are also used to operate the games without complexing by arrays or creating new values from each operators or functions.

==================================================================================

Thanks for your support by experiencing my game. Hope to see you in further games.
